# Wavemaker
## How WaveMaker accelerates enterprise app development
### Develop rich, responsive apps using modern UI features
WaveMaker low-code platform auto-generates open standards-based readable code, with its drag-and-drop features and modern UI frameworks such as Angular 7, ensuring rich UI and responsive UX.
### Automate creation of APIs from existing services
WaveMaker provides one-click API creation, where microservices are auto-created and developers can use existing database logic, reuse existing Java code and create new Java code in IDEs of their choice, such as Eclipse.
### Abstract complexity and achieve full stack development
WaveMaker abstracts underlying complexities of binding UI to back-end data sources, security configuration, API integration and creation, etc., and helps developers own and manage end-to-end application development.
### Democratize the delivery and deployment process
WaveMaker supports CI/CD, helping developers deploy application artifacts to any Java application server, and makes it effortless to deploy on-premises or on multi cloud by integrating with existing enterprise CI tools like Jenkins.
### Migrate from proprietary technologies easily
WaveMaker allows you to leverage existing assets and reuse components; the visual development features make it easy to migrate from legacy applications based on proprietary technologies such as Lotus Notes, MS Access and Oracle Forms.
## Why WaveMaker appeals to enterprise IT teams
### Architectural best practices
WaveMaker cloud-native applications have session-less architecture, decoupled frontend and back-end layers using REST API and configuration driven security and deployment models. 
### Framework-driven approach
WaveMaker brings component-based UI development framework using Angular with extensions built as prefabs, microservices based services using Spring, Hibernate with extensions built as connectors. 
### Security best practices
WaveMaker apps are built with enterprise-grade security best practices hardened for penetration testing and offer RBAC against vulnerabilities at each layer i.e. database, backend services, APIs & UI Components.
### Performance &
Scalability
WaveMaker uses Angular build optimization for code assets to keep sizes optimal ensuring UI performance. The ability to deploy as microservices on containers, helps our customers scale easily.
### Integration in the backyard
WaveMaker supports SOAP and Java-based connectors for any custom integrations, without disrupting existing practices. Developers can continue using their Git, Selenium, Jenkins etc. for testing and CI/CD, thus closing the gap for automation between apps and these systems.
### Coexistence with BPM
Pure play BPM-based workflow engines like Camunda, jBPM, Activiti can be integrated with WaveMaker. Businesses can continue to leverage BPM tools while app teams will provide the necessary integration to plug-in to these workflow 
## How to go agile with WaveMaker (Collaborate on cloud, reduce dependencies, and get to market fast)
### Strengthen the developer toolbox
The developer role is among the hardest to fill. WaveMaker empowers your IT teams with drag-and-drop features and out-of-the-box modern UI frameworks such as Angular, to build with minimal coding while ensuring code quality, maintainability and extensibility.
### Accelerate idea-to-app journey
Say NO to sitting on a huge backlog of user stories. With WaveMaker, app teams can prototype rapidly, collaborate with business teams instantly, and test more features. This clears backlog and paves way for experimentation with all kinds of ideas.
### Boost adaptability to change
Welcoming change, even late in the SDLC is a fundamental principle in the agile manifesto. By freeing up time spent in hand-coding, data integration, and manual deployment, WaveMaker allows for focus on the customer, making changes to apps easy, and managing those changes easier.
### Easily deploy at scale with speed
By its very nature, enterprise app development demands scale. WaveMaker platform with auto-containerization, cloud-native architecture and integrated CI/CD pipeline can automate your entire deployment process, resulting in real-time updates to the cloud without any delays.
